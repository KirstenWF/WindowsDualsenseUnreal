## üìñ About the Project

This is an Unreal Engine plugin that enables native communication with DualSense‚Ñ¢ (PlayStation 5) and DualShock 4¬Æ (PlayStation 4) controllers on Windows systems. It exposes the unique features of each controller, such as Haptic Feedback and Adaptive Triggers of DualSense, through an easy-to-use Blueprint and C++ function library.

The goal is to bridge the gap left by generic controller support on Windows, giving developers direct access to the features that make Sony controllers so immersive.

## ‚ú® Features

* üîå **Dynamic Connection (Hot-Swap)**: Automatically detects controller connection and disconnection, even during gameplay.
* ‚ö° **Optimized for Multiplayer**: High-performance architecture with minimal impact on network games.
* üéÆ **Seamless Input Integration**: Coexists perfectly with Unreal Engine's native input managers (like Enhanced Input) and other gamepad plugins, preventing conflicts between devices.
* üéØ **Adaptive Triggers**: Full control over resistance, effect, and vibration on R2/L2 triggers.
* üîä **Audio-Based Vibration**: Synchronize the controller's haptic feedback with any in-game audio source.
* üí° **Lightbar Control**: Dynamically change the controller's LED color.
* üé§ **Microphone and Audio**: Manage the mute button LED, speaker volume, and headset audio.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Force Feedback**: Native integration with Unreal Engine's Force Feedback system for standard motor vibration.
* üéÆ **Multi-Controller Support**: Manage up to 4 controllers simultaneously.

## üé¨ Demo

## üéÆ Example Project: Parrot Game Sample

To demonstrate the practical use of the **Windows Dualsense Unreal Plugin**, a sample project has been developed using the [*Parrot Game Sample*](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/parrot-game-sample-for-unreal-engine) from Epic Games. This project integrates key features of the DualSense controller to enhance the player's experience.

![Parrot Game Sample](Images/parrot-game-sample-banner.jpg)


### Implemented Features

In this sample, the following DualSense functionalities were integrated to provide a more immersive gameplay experience:

* **Visual Feedback**: The controller's Lightbar is used to provide real-time visual feedback to the player, changing colors and effects according to in-game events.
* **Vibration (Force Feedback)**: The native Force Feedback system was used to create detailed vibration effects, increasing immersion during key moments of gameplay.

> üí° **Pro Tip for Deeper Immersion**: For an enhanced audio experience, connect the controller via USB and plug a headset directly into it. This setup also works with a Bluetooth connection, offering greater flexibility.

This project serves as a practical guide for developers who want to see the plugin in action and learn how to integrate the unique features of the DualSense controller into their own games.

### Where to Download

You can download the *Parrot Game Sample* with the DualSense integration directly from our GitHub repository.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Unreal Engine**: 5.2 or higher.
* **Operating System**: Windows 10 or 11.
* **Controller**: DualSense‚Ñ¢ or DualShock 4¬Æ.

### Quick Installation

1.  Go to the official plugin page on the Unreal Engine Marketplace (FAB): [Plugin Page - FAB](https://www.fab.com/listings/e77a8f1d-8bbe-4673-a5ae-7f222c8c0960)
2.  Click **Install** or **Add to Project** and select your Unreal Engine project.
3.  Activate the plugin in Unreal Engine:
    * Open your project.
    * Go to `Edit > Plugins`.
    * Search for **Windows Dualsense Plugin** and check the box.
4.  Restart Unreal Engine when prompted.

## üíª Basic Usage

The plugin exposes all functionality through static Blueprint function libraries, meaning you can call methods from anywhere without needing to add components.

### Blueprint Function Libraries

The functions are divided into two main categories for easy access:

* **Sony Gamepad**: Contains management methods common to Sony controllers (DualShock and DualSense), such as LED control, gyroscope, battery level, etc.
* **DualSense Effects**: Contains methods specific to DualSense exclusive features, such as Adaptive Triggers configuration.

**Example 1: Light Control (Lightbar & LEDs)**
You can dynamically change the controller's Lightbar color or set the player indicator LEDs.

**Example 2: Trigger Effects (Category: DualSense Effects)**
Call functions directly to control DualSense features. Some available effects include:

* üêé **Galloping**: Simulates a horse's trot.
* üí™ **Resistance**: Applies constant opposing force when pressing the trigger.
* üî´ **Weapon**: Creates a recoil effect for semi-automatic weapons.
* üî• **Automatic Gun**: Vibrates rapidly to simulate an automatic weapon.

### Motor Vibration (Force Feedback)

The motor vibration of both DualSense and DualShock 4 is automatically handled by Unreal Engine's native **Force Feedback** system. This means any force feedback event will trigger the controller's vibration without extra setup.

### Multiplayer Management

To manage multiple controllers in a local scenario, the recommended approach is to use your project's **GameMode**. In the `PostLogin` event, you can assign a controller to each new player that connects.
